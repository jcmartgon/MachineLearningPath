# Machine Learning Path

## Description

The goal of this repository is to keep track of all the relevant files corresponding to the several courses I intend on taking to further my understanding on Machine Learning. The path in question was strongly inspired by Ahmad Anis' at https://towardsdatascience.com/beginners-learning-path-for-machine-learning-5a7fb90f751a, although modifications have been made.
