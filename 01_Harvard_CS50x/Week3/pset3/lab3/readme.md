# Lab 3: Sorting algorithm identification

The following 3 algorithms are provided:

* sort1.exe
* sort2.exe
* sort3.exe

Likewise, the following datasets are provided:

* random5000.txt
* random10000.txt
* random50000.txt
* reversed5000.txt
* reversed10000.txt
* reversed50000.txt
* sorted5000.txt
* sorted10000.txt
* sorted50000.txt

The number in the file name represents the amount of values within it, the numbers within the random files have been shuffled, those within the reversed files have been reversed, and those within the sorted ones are fully sorted.

Since their source code is not provided, tests must be performed with the datasets in order to determine which sort is which out of the following:

* bubble sort
* selection sort
* merge sort

Conclusions must be detailed in the "answers.txt" file.

## Running

To run:
1. Make sure you've got a C compiler installed
2. Use either the "./sort1", "/sort2", or "./sort" commands followed by the name of the dataset to run
