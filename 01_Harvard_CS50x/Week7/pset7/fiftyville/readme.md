# Fiftyville

Write SQL queries to solve a mystery.

The task is to identify the thief, it's escape destination and accomplice based on the information on the 'fiftyville.db' database.

The queries have been stored in the 'log.sql' file with my thoughts recorded as comments after each query; answers have been recorded in the 'answers.txt' file.
